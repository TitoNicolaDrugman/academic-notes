# Academic Notes Repository

Welcome to my notes repository! Here you'll find all the notes I took during my bachelor’s and master’s degrees. I could make people pay for these notes, but I believe in open access to education. As someone once said: ***"Culture shouldn't exist only for those who can afford it"***.

# About This Repository

This repository contains a variety of notes from courses I attended throughout my academic journey. These notes are offered for free and are open-source for anyone who might find them useful. However, please keep in mind that this is a partial collection. In some cases, I wrote directly on professor-provided materials or course textbooks, which I cannot share publicly for copyright reasons, but if you need those materials, text me.

# Website Version [link](https://titonicoladrugman.github.io/academic-notes/)

I’m also creating a website to host these notes for easier access. This is only my second attempt at building something with HTML, so it's a work in progress. Right now it’s not very interactive, but I plan to make it more user-friendly and engaging as soon as I have more free time.

# Notes Accuracy and Updates

Please be aware that my notes may not always be perfectly accurate. Some content might be incorrect, outdated or incomplete. Many of these notes are from courses I took several years ago (some dating back to 2021). Course curricula might have changed since then, so it's a good idea to cross-reference the topics with the current syllabus.

If you spot errors or have suggestions for improvements, I would deeply appreciate your contributions. I will try to update these notes as much as I can when time allows.

How You Can Help

- Corrections: Found something wrong? Let me know.

Thank you for exploring this repository! You are free to download and edit everything here, please just remember to give me some credits and to text me if you find something helpful, I would really really appricate it. I genuinely hope these notes can help someone out there. **Knowledge is meant to be shared**.

Happy learning!
