; I have 3 two euros coins, 2 one euro coin and 6 twenty cent coins; I must
; pay 6.20 euros at the bar. In how many different ways can I pay?

(declare-const twoeuro Int)
(declare-const oneeuro Int)
(declare-const twentycents Int)

(assert (and ( >= twoeuro 0)(< twoeuro 4)))
(assert (and ( >= oneeuro 0)(< oneeuro 3)))
(assert (and ( >= twentycents 0)(< twentycents 7)))

(assert (= 6.20	(+
						(* twoeuro 2)
						(* oneeuro 1)
						(* twentycents 0.20)
)))

; negate first solution
(assert  (not (and ( = twoeuro 2)( = oneeuro 2)( = twentycents 1)       )))

; negate second solution
(assert  (not (and ( = twoeuro 2) ( = oneeuro 1) ( = twentycents 6) )))

; negate third solution
(assert  (not (and ( = twoeuro 3) ( = oneeuro 0) ( = twentycents 1) )))


; since I get unsat there are only three possible solutions

(check-sat)
(get-value (twoeuro oneeuro twentycents ))
