QUESTION EXERCISE 1

Suppose we are given a language L consisting of a binary predicate R, a
unary predicate P and the individual constants a, b, c.

R binary
P unary
a,b,c individual constants

R(P(x), y)
∃x(P(x) ∧ R(x, x))
∃x(R(x, y) ∧ P(x))
P(a)
R(a, x) → P(c)
∀x∀y(R(x, y) → R(y, x))

which ones are grammatically correct? which ones are sentences? which
ones are open? which ones are ground? which ones are universal?

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; 
1. R(P(x), y)
Not correct, since both P(x) and R(x) are both predicates and you can not have R(P(x), y)


;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2. ∃x(P(x) ∧ R(x, x))
It is grammatically correct
A sentence is a formula in which no variable occours free, since x is always not free that it is a sentence
It is not open since there is no free variable
It is not ground since x is a variable
it is not universal, since there aren't only universal quantifier


;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
3. ∃x(R(x, y) ∧ P(x))
It is grammatically correct
A formula is a sentence if no variable occours free, since y occurs free it is not a sentence
It is open since y is a free variable
It is not ground since x and y are both variables
It is not universal since there is no universal quantifier

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
4. P(a)
It is grammatically correct
A sentence is a formula in which no variable occurs free, since there is no variable it is a sentence
It is not close since there is no free variable
It is ground
It is not universal since there is no universal quantifier

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
5. R(a, x) → P(c)
It is grammatically correct
A sentence is a formula in which no variables occurs free, since x is free it is not a sentence
It is open since x is a free variable
It is not ground since x is a variable
It is not universal since there is no universal quantifier


;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
6. ∀x∀y(R(x, y) → R(y, x))
It is grammatically correct
A sentence is a formula in which no variable occours free, since both y and x are not free than it is sentence
It is not open since both x and y are not free
It is not ground since x and y are variables
It is universal since there are only universal quantifier

1.1 The elements of the Herbrand Universe are a,b,c

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Skolemize the sentence ∃x∃yR(x, y); what is now the Herbrand universe?
subsitute d with ∃x, that is
∃yR(d, y)
And e for ∃y, that is
R(d, e)

The Herbrand universe now is composed by
a,b,c,d,e, so it is finite

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Skolemize the sentence ∀x∀y∃z(R(x, y) → P(z)); is the Herbrand uni-
verse now still finite? If not, describe a set of infinite elements of it.

Substitue ∃z with f(x,y) that is
∀x∀y(R(x, y) → P(f(x,y)))
f(f(x,y), f(x,y)) it is infinite
