; On an island, there live exactly two types of people: knights and knaves.
; Knights always tell the truth and knaves always lie. I landed on the island,
; met two inhabitants, A and B, and asked A: ”Is one of you a knight?”. His
; answer was the negative; what can be said about the types of A and B? Is
; there more than one possibility?


(declare-sort D)
(declare-const a D)
(declare-const b D)
(declare-fun Kni (D) Bool)
(declare-fun Kna (D) Bool)

; a is either a Kni or a Kna
(assert (xor (Kni a)(Kna a)))

; b is either a Kni or a Kna
(assert (xor (Kni b)(Kna b)))

; "Is one of you a knight?"
; if A is knight, tell the truth
(assert (=>(Kni a)(not(or (Kni a)(Kni b)))))

; if A is a knave, tell lie
(assert (=> (Kna a) (or(Kni a)(Kni b))))
